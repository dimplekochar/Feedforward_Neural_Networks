# Decision_Tree
Each decision node will correspond to one of the features in train.csv, which is selected by choosing the feature that maximizes information gain. The features in train.csv and test.csv are either continuous-valued (i.e. falling within a range) or discrete-valued (i.e. one of N values).
Useing Python code to implement the DT classifier, it accepts three arguments: train.csv, test.csv and an integer value for the maximum depth of the tree.
